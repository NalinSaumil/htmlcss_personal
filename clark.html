      <h1>lark Middle School (My Fourth USA School)
      </h1>
      <p>Clark Middle School was the first time I felt like I was doing great and my indian knowledge background helping me out alot. My fast-learning abilities and awesome abilities to remember what is learned was actually handy in this culture and I, for a fact, loved it. All the teachers were great (except for one) and I made a whole lot of friends. So this was a pretty good school. Plus this is my first middle school that I graduated and thankfully the last. This is where I left middle school and Started the adventures of high school.
