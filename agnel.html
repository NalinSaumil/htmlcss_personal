      <h1>Fr. Agnel School (My Third School)
      </h1>
      <p>Fr. Agnel School was the first school in which I had no friends that I had already known from my past. Except for a cousin from my dad's side I had no one that I actually knew in that school. So this was the first school that I had to settle in and believe me it was hard especially if you are joining a grade in the middle of the year. But somehow things worked out and everything was awesome. Now that I am in Texas I kind of miss all my friends that I met there. It would be nice if I could enter the school again and meet them and see their faces as they try to recognize who I am and also when they, all of a sudden, get the memories that them and I shared.
