      <h1>MAF Academy (My Fisrt School)
      </h1>
      <p>MAF Academy was my first school. It is located in India and is still in buisness. I studied there for Kindergarten and First grade. Almost all my friends there lived in the same apartment complex as me. In fact, I knew almost all of my friends since I was born. We were all born only months away from each other, sometimes just days of difference.
