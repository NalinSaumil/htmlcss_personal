      <h1>My future(obviously tech-related)
      </h1>
      <p>So my future is what I like to call kind of undecided. You see my future is decided that it will tech related but not decided what in tech-related.  I want to grow up to be a programmer but I never really work towards anything in my life or have a set series of goals that will lead me to the future. If anyone asks, I say that I want to be a software developer and join google. My teacher Mr. Buntyn has inspired me to think about my goals and move as I go along.
