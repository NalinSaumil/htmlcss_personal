      <h1>Lebanon Trail High School (My Fifth USA School
      </h1>
      <p>Lebanon Trail is my First High School and also the BIGGEST school in my school district. I was so glad to be here specially since it was just built. Yup thats right LTHS is est. 2016. So even when I am still a freshman I still am the biggest grade there. But bad news is that there is a great chance that I will leave this school after 9th grade because we are buying a new house in Prosper, TX and I might move Prosper High which I don't want to. So I am still in the process of begging my parents to somehow let me stay in Frisco, TX so that I don't have to mis this awesome once in a lifetime oppurtunity of getting a brand new high school and not having to worry about softmores, juniors, and seniors above us and not leaving my continuity in this school and not having to leave my friends. So I pray to god to let me, oh please let me stay in Frisco and enjoy this awesome high school.
