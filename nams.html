      <h1>North Andover Middle School (My Third USA School)
      </h1>
      <p>North Andover Middle School is probably second-most-studied-at school. Over here I completed 6th Grade and 2/3 of 7th grade. This was my first middle school ever. Here all the new prospects of being a TBT (To be Teen) started. I just had THE TALK and was experiencing people taking this very loosely. Making fun of it and using ""THE BAD WORDS"" very frequently because all of a sudden you've been granted a whole new level of freedom you have no idea about. So yeah pretty wacky stuff and all.
