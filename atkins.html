      <h1>Atkinson Elementary School (My Second USA School)
      </h1>
      <p>Atkinson Elementary was the first time in USA when I got the welcome that I was looking for. I think this was because all of the indian friends that I had (I am indian by the way) lived in my apartment complex so we became very good friends. This was also The first school where I completed (as in finished) not 1 but 2 grades and came very close to finishing my third one but we had to move again. In fact their were only about 3 months left in the year. So this was my first official year of school.
