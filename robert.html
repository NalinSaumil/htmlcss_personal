      <h1>Robertson Elementary School (My First USA School)
      </h1>
      <p>Robertson Elementary School was the first time I ever went to school in the United States of America. When I first arrived at this school I had no idea abiut the american culture or the accent here. The school didn't help either. This school was probably the worst school I had in the USA and it was probably my fault in my unknowing. So my first impression of USA was pretty bad in the sense of sociality.
