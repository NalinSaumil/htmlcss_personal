      <h1>Ryan International School (My Second School)
      </h1>
      <p>Ryan International School was the First School where I witnessed a teacher resign from her job. Sadly, that teacher was one the best, funniest and my favoroite teachers, and this was not just true for me but the entire grade. So when she left, the entire grade cried for her to stay at our school but her resignation had to be done. So she left. Also this was the last school that I ever attended with my friends from birth. But that doesn't mean we weren't friends anymore I still played with them when I returned home. I studied at this school for Second and Third grade.
