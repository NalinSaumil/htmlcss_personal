      <h1>Lifestyle Montessori School (My Fisrt Out-Of-India School)
      </h1>
      <p>Lifestyle Montessori School(LMS) was my first school out of India. Here everything was new to me. The weird thing was that they put you into a grade according to your age. So I was put into 1st grade when I was actually in 3rd, and since I was too strong in this grade I was moved to 3rd grade. But since their standards for third grade was still too low for me I was moved to 5th grade and then stayed their. I was praised their alot though because of my storng knowledge and the ability to work fast especially in mathematics. You know this entire moving/skipping grades thing happened within 5 months. But my parents thought that the study level here was decreasing my brain capacity so we had to move back to India.
